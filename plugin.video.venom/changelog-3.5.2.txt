    search of youtube for trailers[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed how restarting a previousely watched movie
    or episode is handled. Previousely the title would be
    marked unwatched upon replaying a previousely
    watched item. Now the watched indicator is not
    changed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added ability to pass to skin resume points.  This now
    allows for skin to use a watched progress indicator.[/I]

    setting page option to remove item from navigation.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.1 - Feb. 8, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Scraper function cache now written to the providers.db
    instead of cache.db.  Now using "Clear Providers" will
    wipe both links and function cache with no need to use
    "Clear cache". This will help preserve meta data.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Updated "context.venom" addon to now include the
    following new global context options as follows.
    "Clear Providers"
    "Find Similar"

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.9 - Feb. 3, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trakt Progress fix to resolve random incorrect NextUp
    items to watch due to TVDB v1 api season/episodes out
    of order in xml.  The xml sort order was changed to be
    based on ID's and no longer sorted by season/episode.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added translation lookup for title and plot when language
 changed from English.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.8 - Jan. 27, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed query check for TVDB SeriesName and IMDB_ID
    for a more accurate title match for missing ID's .[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Revert solely to using requests.get() for 1-23 changes
    to TVDB legacy SSL support.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] fanart.tv module changed to using requests.get() with
    added response checks[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added notification for fanart.tv requests when server
    errors occur.  I suggest upon seeing this notification to
    disable extended artwork to combat the server
    errors until normal operation resumes.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.7 - Jan. 21, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to check for Venom updates at
    startup. Useful for those that turn off Auto Updates.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to enable-disable resolution icons
    in source select dialog.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added sort() method to TV Shows-Network
    (TVMaze) to maintain consistency with TVMaze api
    response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed Library import method from reading
    selected item to now fetch new meta.  This now better
    respects on the fly changes made to "Enable Special
    Season(0) and "Show unaired season/episodes".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New TVDB api key in use.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.6 - Jan. 16, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Another fix for this weeks TVDB change to SSL.
    Seems this week some shows are back to working with
    legacy SSL support while others do not.  What this now
    means is urllib2.urlopen() request works for some shows
    while requests.get() works for others.  When the request
    does not satisfy the SSL requirement the response xml's
    are empty yet server still responds with <Response 200>
    I've now coded a check for the first request and if the xml's
    are empty then we'll use requests.get().  This appears to now
    get all shows back to laoding season/episode lists.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed settings.xml typo from last update.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.5 - Jan. 11, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fix for TVDB latest change to SSL requirement.
    Thank you ruiner!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few settings tweaks for non Trakt users to hide
    options not pertaining to them.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Tools option to clean, remove old deprecated
    settings from userdata settings.xml.  New option will clean
    both Venom and OpenScrapers.  Please note that until
    OpenScrapers pushes the PR request this only works
    for Venom at this time.  Openscrapers update is coming
    for this to also work there.  This tool will also auto run
    upon new Venom update. Courtesy of FEN!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few tweaks to TV Shows - Networks to fix random
    dropped titles due to None types in api response.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.4 - Jan. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Trakt watch/unwatched context menu options.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.3 - Jan. 02, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed loop issue with re-occurring library yes/no dialog.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.2 - Dec. 31, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Add Show to Watchlist" and "Remove Show
    from Watchlist" options to Trakt Manager when
    viewing seasons or episodes.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Hide Movie" or "Hide Show" options to Trakt
    Manager to hide from Progress and Calendar.  Use
    to cleanup within the addon folks!  Load time can be
    sped up cleaning out old itmes you may never finish
    a series of.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Made separate notifications settings for Trakt Server
    Notifications and General Notifications.  General Notifications
    covers Trakt Manager functions only and can now be turned
    off independently of Trakt Server/Timeout issues.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added widget refresh function for Trakt changes done
    within the addon.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed caching of Trakt Progress list so item changes
    are shown immediately.  This does cause reloading of Progress
    list to load no faster on subsequent loading of the list.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.1 - Dec. 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Trakt/TMDb list imports not adding "list_name"
    to database when imported from My Movies or My TVShows.
    This caused service update failures.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.0 - Dec. 26, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added 2nd notification to library folder check notification
    for auto folder setup.  Now if you answer "no" to the auto
    folder setup you will be presented with a 2nd yes-no dialog
    asking if you'd also like to disable the "Auto Update Service".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Update Service failure if no user lists were
    previously imported under the new system. The failure
    occurred because the db table was only written during
    the import process so service update checks did not
    find this table and halted the entire update process.
    This has been fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed occasional duplicate folder entries in the Kodi
    "MyVideos*.db" file.  This occurs because Kodi does
    not fully remove path table entries when manually
    deleted but instead Kodi zeroes out the values so it's
    not seen.  This has been fixed to remove those old
    entries when using the auto folder setup process.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed link caching process outside of Venom due
    to no global context menu to "Rescrape".  Global
    context menu options are in the works so this is a
    temp solution.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.9 - Dec. 23, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed broken for loop from previous update preventing
    Library Updates from completing.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Disney+ and Showcase to TVShows Networks.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.8 - Dec. 23, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Switched from Trakt slug check for ID's to Trakt IDLookup
    method. Slug checks seems to report same IMDB_ID
    but different TVDB_ID for some shows. IDLookup method
    is less prone to errors.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb Watchlist, Favorites, and Userlist to library
    import options for both Movies and TV Shows.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Happy Holidays to Everyone![/I

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.7 - Dec. 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added extra folder path check when comparing Venom
    library folders to Kodi's MyVideos*.db file.  Now 
    "special://userdata" and translated paths are both
    checked.  This solves issues with moved or manually
    added folders.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new sort function as a temporary workaround to
    solve the out of order Season Specials and Episode
    index problems from TVDb v1 api.  TVDb is aware
    of the condition.  Sadly this still does not fix the issues
    with Trakt-Progress being incorrect at times for next
    episode to watch, that problem occurs because the
    index is very often out of order so the wrong NextUp
    episode is grabbed.fried.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] If you do not use Venom's Library integration please
    disable the "Auto Update Service" under Settings-Library.
    The new library folder check and auto setup prompt now
    runs inside the existing service so it will cause the pop
    up notification for setup.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.6 - Dec. 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new function to move traceback error logging to
    addon log vs. kodi log.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added .setCast() to player.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added automated setup to add "Venom Library folders"
    to Kodi Sources under "Settings-Library".  A notice will
    also pop up requesting this automated setup if folders
    were not added to Kodi sources and you attempt to
    import lists to library.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added ability to Import Trakt user lists and liked lists for
    Movies and TV Shows. This is also added as a service
    to update any titles later added online to Trakt account.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] "Add to Library" and "Update Libray" now respect setting options
    for "Show Unaired" and "Season Special(Season0)".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added option to "Tools-Library" for "Clean Library".[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.5 - Dec. 02, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed typo effecting all IMDb TV Show lists not loading. Sorry folks
    was pretty sad seeing it.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.4 - Dec. 02, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed 40 item limit sent to resolveURL to now check all links till
    resolved link found. This will rid the "No stream available"
    notification seen after 40 links checked and not resolved[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "Shortcuts" to last category in Settings for faster access. Also
    changed setting query to not land on first item in 
    category so there is no need to arrow over and
    down to another category in Settings[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Clear All Cache" to all context menu options.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed metacache issue due to trakt api having some shows with
    same tvdb_id but different imdb_id or tmdb_id.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Made all trakt lists now respect setting for "Season0" displayed or
    not displayed.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with UpNext "Playback Failed" at start of 2nd item in
    playlist.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed "Survivor bug" writing show to library but this in Venom
    is due to new profile data retrieved from tvdb for cast
    and profile pics that yielded 576 cast members for this
    show that proved to much for sql database write.  I've
    reduced max cast to 200 and cures it on Win and Shield
    so please let me know device specific if this still fails.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.3 - Nov. 24, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Sorry folks missed an entry in last update for TVDb name change[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.2 - Nov. 24, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.1 - Nov. 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVDb for new changed xml file names.  Please note TVDb is still not
    fully fixed on their end. On 11-16-19 I retrieved the
    xmls to discover many tags inside the files were
    missing data, or lacked closing tags, so looks like
    they have more updating to do.  Season posters
    are not working at this time from them and they're
    only providing a show poster.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting option to remove "CAM and SD sources".  Note this new
    option will only take place if better than
    "CAM and SD" sources exists to avoid nothing
    returned for links.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option to remove "3D sources".[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting Category called "Shortcuts".  This now allows you to
    clear specific cache without backing out of menus
    and going into Tools. Call up "Venom Settings"
    and go to "Shortcuts" anywhere.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.0 - Oct 27, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Re-wrote TV Shows-Calendar (TVMaze). Hard coded shows air time
    to display and changed sort to match api response
    order for time aired.  Added extended artwork from
    fanart.tv. Added season.posters[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Addeed setting option "Direct Progress Scraping" for Trakt Progress list.
    This will now bypass the Trakt secondary progress episode list and begin
    scraping current selected episode instead.  Added
    context menu option "Browse Progress" for when
    new setting option is enabled to allow bypassing
    on the fly. Added new context menu option
    "Direct Progress Scrape" when new setting
    option is not enabled.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed episode ID ""None" type issue for occasional missing ids in Trakt
    api response during TV Show search when
    Up Next is enabled.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.8 - Oct 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVShow search results due to trakt api response duplicating
    shows with "None" type years, similar for Movies.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed Trakt OnDeck to follow intedended shortened version of
    "Unfinished" list, per api docs.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added resolution icons for source directory list, note not all skins support
    this and may not be seen.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed default sort for TVShows Calendar sorting to "Date Premiered".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "season.poster" fallback when not available.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.7 - Oct 16, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more api languages in settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more provider languages in settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed episode "poster" to ""season.poster" to be
    more descriptive of the season you are viewing.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TMDb threading to "for" loop thread for 2nd
    api request and fanart.tv request.  Huge speed bump in menu load times.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Some tweaks to TMDb user list sorting.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb has now fixed user lists from dropping titles due to a lang issue.
    Thank you Travis!!![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.6 - Oct 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more Navigation options to now cover most all.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed IMDb lists from local sort method to server request sorting.  This allows
    "Date Added" for IMDb lists to now work.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "My List" to Navigation settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Hard coded "Movie-Collections" sort order to release_date.asc. In the event user
    changes Movie sort to "Title" or "Date Added" this made more sense to keep a
    movie collection in order of release date, occurrence, in order as 1, 2 ,3 etc.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "season count" and "unwatched count" to main "TV Shows" and out of
    UpNext settings, made no sense being there.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to turn on notification sounds, now off by
    default for ALL.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added tvShort to IMDb url for Movie user lists.  This allows short films to be
    brought in to lists even if TV aired.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Aded IMDb "My Ratings" to "My Lists" for both Movies and TVShows.  Added
    filtering for both due to IMDb does not handle "title_type" for user Rating lists.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.5 - Oct 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb user lists to TVShows.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added next page count display.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb watchlist and user lists for movies.  Note this requires a special
    authorization to obtain a session_id.  This new authorization is found in the
    settings under API keys.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.3 - Sept 30, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

    to fix skin issue seen in Estuary.[/I]

    duration.  Now if Trakt activity is newer than cache write date the new data will be
    fetched[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Trakt lists sort by Title to ignore articles (the, and, an).[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reworked multiline source list. There is now a 2nd line color choice option in
    settings. Switched formatting of 2nd line to Italic. Removed occasional 0 values.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a few new colors to various options in settings.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.1.9 - Sept 11, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reverted back to Trakt non page lists due to issue with api sorting in response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed indicators from "for" loop causing menu slow downs due to unnecessary
    calls to function.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting option to enable-disable duplicate sources returned.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Trakt caching method to extend cache valid duration.  Now we check for
    a change in Trakt WatchedActivity occurs and refreshes Trakt list immediately.  If
    nothing new is watched cache can be held for a month until a change occurs.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.1.8 - Aug 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed actor profiles for Silvo skin, note that Silvo skin still has random issues with
    season count due to an ExtendedSeasonPanel that does not work well with 3rd
    party addons so best to disable the season count option.  I do have a modded
    Silvo file to cure the problem if needed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TMDb random extended artwork drops.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed fanart.tv api call to threaded request for TMDb Movies as experimental
    at this time.  Menu load times was marginally shortened by .5-.75 secs.[/I]

    Infolabels for cast and castandrole no longer in use.  Movies are complete but a
    few TVShow lists are unfinished at this time, IMDb to name one.  Sorry folks leaving
    for vaca.  See yall in a week![/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Watched indicator improvements.  Still it seems Kodi has
    random failures causing you to back out and go

    previously broken due to some typos, that is
    now fixed.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.3 - July 07, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed UpNext broken if using new option to "Disable
    Extended artwork".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed fanart.tv request when using IMDb.  It seems fanart.tv
    has been dropping some title ID's so the response
    would not return any artwork.  Perfect example is
    Bohemian Rhapody.  Two weeks ago this title had
    plenty of extended artwork and now it's gone.  Upon
    reviewing the api call the TMDb_ID is still there but
    IMDb has been removed.  Now I check for this and
    pass TMDb ID if "error" in api response.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.2 - July 06, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed IMDb user key issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new option to "Disable Extended artwork(fanart.tv).
    This helps shorten some menu load times at the loss
    of extra poster, extra fanart, clearart and discart.  I've
    set this up to gather at a min poster and fanart from
    either IMDb, TMDb, or TVDb.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed some setting options from "enum" type to
    "select" type.  Instead of having to arrow through the
    options you will now have a pop up list to show you
    all available options in one shot. Options with only
    2 items I left as "enum" type.[/I]
[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.1 - July 03, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed caching of Trakt Progress list. Data should now
    refresh and be current instantly[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed two missing Default icons from last update.  Also
    added a bunch more to now use skin Default styles.
    Best seen with Aura skin.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option "Page Item Limit".  You can now
    set the number of list items per page for Movies and
    TV Shows. Note TMDb api default left at 20 so this
    new option works for IMDb and Trakt lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed occasional File Lock issue under
    some conditions.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed query jump to ResolveURL settings page for PM

    style based on Traditional icons or Meta Provider Logos.
    You can also add the Meta Provider label to the menu
    item .. ex (TMDb).  This helps distinguish between.. ex
    "Popular (IMDb) and Popular (TMDb)[/I]

    calendar.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed old depreciated infoLabel that effected some
    menus showing the watched indicator when in fact the
    episode was not watched. Most notable was Trakt
    Progress. This made the side panel options work in
    reverse when flipping watched to unwatched.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added traceback to a number of new locations.

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.7 - June 22, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed bad key references in metadata.db[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] fixed multiple issues with provider cache calls from
    sources.py file, no .commit() and no .close() used for db
    access.  Multiple iterate of Nonetype objects fixed....hope
    this fixes your Fire OS devices.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added SeasonTotals to set.Property(), used
    by some skins[/I]

    Here" or starting playback from inside the "Playlist Manager"
    -"View Playlist"[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed resume bookmark to yes-no dialog to deal
    with occasional bug in contextmenu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a notification when you stop a movie, or episode,
    that a resume point, and timestamp, was saved if bookmarks are enabled[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed functionality of Episode counters.  Previously if
    you watched an entire season the season list would change
    to a watched indicator only.  Now the episode count will be
    remain visible regardless of watch count.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Special Seasons, or Season 0, from not being displayed.
    Adjusted episode counter to take this Season 0 into account for
    totals[/I]

    directory type list items.  You can add, remove, view playlist,
    and clear entire playlist.  For directory list items I added the
    playlist viewer and playlist clear options.  I suggest using
    the existing "Add to playlist" option for full shows and seasons[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.3 - May 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Source list now utilizes multiline list items. Settings
    contain option to turn this on or off base on your preference.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added a few more networks to TV Shows[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.2 - May 22, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added check for valid debrid account to sources.py. Code
    to remove duplicate links broke if no debrid account.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added discart to movies from fanart.tv[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Trakt "Box Office" to movies.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Navigation controls to settings page to
    turn off dupliacte movie and tv shows from IMDb, TMDb, and Trakt.
    May add more.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added option to Tools menu to reset View Types to default.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.1 - May 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed some broken artwork and studio info for TV Shows "Networks".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added clearart and clearlogo to "Networks". Will display in player.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Trakt watched sync as startup service if valid account.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.8 - May 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reworked TV Show Networks. I discovered that all exo forks parse the
     tvmaze web page titled "This seasons Shows".  If your expecting to find a show
    like HBO's Boardwalk Empire you won't because it's ended, or discontinued. I've
    modified this to parse not only that web page but also the page for "All shows".
    There is now a settings page option to control which method you'd like.  The new
    "All shows" brings in allot more now.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Previous update I adjusted the artwork retrieved to be based
    on like count but only tackled movies at the time.  TV Shows is now included.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.7 - May 16, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few more cache duration tweaks.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a few new TV Networks, Hulu long overdue.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] A big redo of Fanart.tv retrieved artwork.  Artwork is now retrieved based
     on number of likes received as priority throughout.  This means artwork could
    occasionally change.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] updated TMDb's api for soon to be phased out "releases" query parameter,
    replaced by "release_dates".  This updated a good deal of titles certificate/ratings[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.6 - May 14, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks for TV shows this time.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb TV Shows and the results
    are more trustworthy. This allowed me to tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs
    without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb's Upcoming to Movie menu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TMDb Movie Collections to use new tmdb.py indexer[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.5 - May 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks. Extended artwork was causing a failure for some titles
    and list return was not the 20 items, TMDb provides, who's noticed? Extended fanart
    was braking 1-2 titles per page.  That's resolved and each Movie page now yields
    20 items from api response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb movies at this time and the
    results are more trustworthy, TV Shows next then onto IMDb. This allowed me to
    tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] 4k fanart inclusion, previously only 1920 width was allowed and lately many titles
    are 4k fanart only so this was a must change as I noticed the decrease in fanart in
    the interface.  May cause a slight lag and considering adding a 4k fanart option to
    turn this off. Downside is  you will lose some if you turn it off so it's hard coded for
    now as always on[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.4 - May 9, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few TMDb api fixes for missing meta.  Some genre and mpaa cases were dropped
    due to format issues. Some TV Shows runtime/duration returned  more than one
    value so now we index just the first case and this stops seeing "0".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new request function to add a sleep/wait state for TMDB's api to limit the
    number of pop up notifications when rate-limiter is hit.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More code changes and soon the infamous worker() and super_info() functions
    will be gone. They break as many list items as they create![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.3 - May 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to TV Shows.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40
    list items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please
    wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in TV Show lists to indicate IMDb, Trakt,or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Dutch language choice to api[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed thread issue with large User/Watch lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb now has it's own py file and as I move towards separate files for indexing
    TMDb, Trakt, IMDb, and TVDb I have chosen to store these files in the "Indexers"
    folder. As a result all menu navigation py files have been moved to a new "Menu"
    folder.  Some old files were not removed in last update and this has now been
    corrected.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.2 - May 7, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to movies.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list
    items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please wait!
    Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in movies list to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I may scrap all efforts on future TMDb development as I'm not impressed with the
    rate limiter issue and honestly the lists are near identical to IMDb so what's the freakin
    point other than a cluttered interface?! Opinions  welcome!  So it's not yielding brownie
    points thus far with me.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.1 - May 3, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Now using Openscrapers for source providers! Torrent min  seeder option now part
    of Openscraper settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Some accounts moved to Openscrapers, remaining unused accounts have
    been removed[/I]

    now resides there[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.0 - April 30, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New Notification function for additional info.  Default InfoDialog() reported
    Addon Name as heading/Title, and now reports Movie, show, or Episode info if added to
    Trakt etc.  Also turned off annoying sounds for anything other than errors.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.9 - April 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new options to Trakt Manager, Watched, Unwatched, Rate, and Unrate.
    Main function of List items now in Bold and Color to stand out[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Play" options.  Now when set to "Auto Play". Then
    context menu will have option called "Source Select" to override "AutoPlay", formerly
    "Play using..", made little sense what the function did. Works  in reverse if default play
    action is "Directory" you'll see "Auto Play"  as usual[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Queue Item" to "Add to Playlist" to better follow suit
    with new playlist options coming soon[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.8 - April 26, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Scaper fix, 3 Torrents fixed.  Due to number of links being pulled default is now
    set to premeptive termination and forced HD quality, scrape and play is very fastest in this method[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.7 - April 25, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
